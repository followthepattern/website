# The Future of Web Development

Web development has evolved dramatically in the last decade. From simple static pages to highly interactive single-page applications (SPAs), the tools and techniques used by developers have become increasingly sophisticated.

In this article, we’ll explore the past, present, and future of web development — including key trends, new technologies, and what to expect as AI and automation begin to reshape the developer's role.

## A Brief History

The early days of the web were dominated by static HTML and simple styling. JavaScript wasn’t widely used, and dynamic content was served through server-side rendering using technologies like PHP, ASP, or Java Servlets.

By the mid-2000s, AJAX began to change the game. Developers could update parts of a webpage without reloading the entire page. This led to a better user experience and the rise of early SPAs.

## Modern Tooling

Today, frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte have become the norm. Developers write components, manage state with hooks or stores, and build apps with full routing, code-splitting, and lazy loading.

Here’s a look at a typical tech stack:

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Go, Python (FastAPI)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions
